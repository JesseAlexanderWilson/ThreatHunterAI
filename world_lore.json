    "Cyberpunk World": {
        "Setting": "The year is 2093. Humanity has fully embraced cybernetic augmentation, with brain chips, neural implants, and body augments becoming the norm. The world runs on hyper-connected networks, but with this advancement comes vulnerability.",
        "Hacking Dangers": "A skilled hacker can now do more than steal data\u2014they can take over someone's mind, disable limbs, or even induce fatal neurological shutdowns. Cybersecurity is no longer about protecting systems; it's about protecting lives.",
        "The Role of Threat Hunters": "Threat Hunters are the last line of defense against cybercriminals who exploit these vulnerabilities. The Guild operates in the shadows, stopping cyberattacks before they can cause irreversible damage.",
        "Augments & Cyber Abilities": "People can install augments that enhance their cyber defenses or give them digital advantages. Some augments protect against brain hacking, while others enhance perception, reaction speed, or network awareness.",
        "Known Augment Types": [
            "Neural Firewall (Blocks direct brain hacking)",
            "DNS Chip (Allows real-time monitoring of DNS activity)",
            "Quantum Handshake (Unbreakable cryptographic authentication for communications)",
            "Packet Sniffer Eye (Real-time deep packet inspection ability)",
            "Zero-Day Instinct (Enhanced ability to detect zero-day exploits in real-time)"
